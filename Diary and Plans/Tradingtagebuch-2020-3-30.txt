Most significant market changes since opening of US markets in my opinion:
Market open 14:30 
USA 30-
Vix Volatility index+ 
Oil-
Germany 30 goes down, then back up
Eur/USD-
USA 500

Observé the réaction of each market opening To get used To them so that it becomes easy for you To predict them and profit from that kind of movement

Then with time you begin To get you target only by trading those special times
Without staying all day in front of charts

Oil is the most dangerous product in the markets - extreme volatility

I looked at all the charts of the popular CFDs
If you assume that tomorrow is about like today I would suggest the following basic strategy: Start at 7 a.m. and look for Bitcoin and Gold. Buy when it is rising. Look for US tech going up at 7:30 then buy.  Buy Vix at about quarter to 8 when it starts going up. Buy USD when it rises just before 8. Buy Germany 30 (oops forgot the time)
I am not sure about oil. As of yesterday it had too much volatility going up you might get stopped out


Start at 7 a.m. and look for Bitcoin and Gold. Buy when it is rising. 
Look for US tech 100 going up at 7:30 then buy.  
Buy Vix at about quarter to 8 when it starts going up. 
Buy USD when it rises just before 8. 
Buy Germany 30 when it rises at 7:30

Normal SL outside recession:
Oil: 0.3-0.5
Gold: 0.5-1.5
SL: 12-20 points 

Now in recession:
So SL nw ithnk for indices must .be far by 50 points
Oil 0.5 To 1$
Gold 3-5$
