Trying to trade in the morning:
Start at 7 a.m. and look for Bitcoin and Gold. Buy when it is rising. 
Look for US tech 100 going up at 7:30 then buy.  
Buy Vix at about quarter to 8 when it starts going up. 
Buy USD when it rises just before 8. 
Buy Germany 30 when it rises at 7:30

Distance of SL from actual price (point= 1$ or 1€)
So SL for indices must .be far by 50 points 
Oil 0.5 To 1$ 
Gold 3-5$

Challenges:
Trading too late because I needed to fix account problems

Values too expensive:
Bitcoin: 0,05 minimum about 300 Dollars
USD 400 - Use PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund
Germany 30 - Use part of shares (Komma)

Important not to wait too long in the beginning


Suggested general trading opportunities:
Germany 30 (DAX)
France 40
US 30
US Nasdaq 100
Gold 
Platin 
Oil
